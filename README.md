# browser_history_aggregator

It runs only local so far and only fetches the browser history across macOS and Linux. There is no computation yet.

# Requirements
It requires giving to Terminal "Full Disk Access" (if you read the code, you will see why). 

Not sure if it happens in Linux, didn't test.
